# Smart_PowerPlug

This was my final paper in electronics technician in 2013.

The project consists of a power plug that includes a real-time power measure (active power) and sends the data to the Labview.

In the report, you can find more details about the hardware used to acquire the power data and send it via serial to the Labview and also the block diagram used in LabVIEW.
